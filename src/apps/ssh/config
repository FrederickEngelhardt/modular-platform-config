# Host can be anything as long as the Host url is reachable.
# Host lets you safely alias credentials so multiple credentials can be used for the same url
# example abc@org.dev could reach github by doing a git clone git@org.dev:TestOrg/testRepo.git
# This can be accomplished by adding a HostName github.com underneath the Host alias
# Host vllc.dev
  # HostName github.com
