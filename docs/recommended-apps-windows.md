# Recommended Apps Windows

Install these manually. Typically latest version is ideal. Most of these apps relate to software development, design, productivity, and security. 

**Everyone** can benefit from productivity modules...your workflows should speedup significantly.

The security options are not focused about total solutions like disc scanning, but solutions that prevent spyware and extensive tracking from services.

### IDEs and Terminal for Mac

- [Windows Terminal](https://iterm2.com/downloads.html). Way better than mac osx terminal
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) IDE that works wonderfully on windows.
- [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) 
    - For C#, Unity, Or UnrealEngine C++. Very powerful editor, expensive licensing.
    - Massive time saving w/ intuitive UI makes a huge difference compared to clunky Visual Studio. (NOT VSCode)
    - Free for open source C#/C++ projects...you will need to meet the requirements and actively be maintaining the project.
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) Works on all platforms, windows work pretty well. 
    - Side note: Make sure you do not abstract or download Android studio APIs within windows subsystem linux as it can create a nasty abstraction between windows and the WSL vm.
    - React Native can be extremely fast on Android + Windows machine, but may take many steps to get there.
    - Some GPUs and processors like AMD use to not work well (~2017-2019 AMD cpu did not run android emulators fast). They should be supported now (as of 2024)

### Productivity (move windows with hotkeys)

  - [divvy](https://mizage.com/divvy/) Free but there is a paid version. It so much less intuitive than Rectangle but works similarly and allows quick resizing by hotkey. Saves time and makes it much easier to resize windows that are focused
  - [Microsoft PowerToys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/) This tool should be installed by everyone.
    - ALT+SPACE search that actually finds items in folders fast unlike finder and a ton of other utilities. It's suspicious that microsoft does not ship this with their base operating system, almost like they intent to slowdown their less informed users.
    - Pinning windows on top. Making it extremely easy to do development and way less window tabbing fatigue.


### Design

  - [Miro](https://miro.com/) great for brainstorming. Sketch can do this well too. Their web version works well if there is no windows app.

### Networking & Security

- Windows defender...but with realtime protection explicitly turned off for ANY development resources.

## Time Tracking
